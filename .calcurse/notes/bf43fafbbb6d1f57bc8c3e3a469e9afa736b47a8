Hello my fellow Toronto Calligraphy Enthusiasts!

Calligraphy gurus Salman Khattak (@salmankhattak (https://www.instagram.com/salmankhattak/)) and Priyanka Rego (@papertrailsdesignco (https://www.instagram.com/papertrailsdesignco/)) will be hosting another fun month of ink, pens, and all things "Calligraphy". Bring your pens, ink, paper, and any art supplies to share. New members welcome! No experience required.

Lots to learn, plenty of amazing people to meet, simply come out and be inspired! Hope to see you there!

UPDATE: Our dear Priyanka Rego has arranged for us to meet at Paper plus Cloth in downtown Toronto for the month of April - thank you Priyanka. Seating is limited so we attendees will need to RSVP for the event. It is first come first serve but we request you register only if you plan on attending. It is ok if your plans change, just let us know so we can offer the ticket so someone on the waitlist :-)
