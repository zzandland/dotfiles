Event
Members are placed into groups of four based on their language level. Each 40 minute session consists of friendly, casual conversation, and/or informal study.

RSVP & Late Policy - Important!
Failure to show, arriving after 5:40 PM (15 minutes late), and cancelling after 11:00 AM on the day of the event all constitute a "no-show". Members are removed from the group after their third no-show.

Waiting List

Members can join the waiting list if an event is full. Should a spot become available. Please note that this spot is available to anyone on a first-come first-serve basis.

PLEASE BE ADVISED: Members from the “Waiting” list are moved automatically to the “Going” list by the system when a spot opens up. You may or may not get a notification from Meetup when this happens. So only sign up on the “Waiting list” for an event if you are sure you can come for it. If the system automatically puts you on the “Going” list and you don't show up to the event, you will receive a strike.

Dinner
Depending on interest, we may go for dinner afterwards.
