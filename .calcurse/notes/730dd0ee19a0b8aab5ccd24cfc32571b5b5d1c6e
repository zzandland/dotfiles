 Arrival
 Please arrive at 9:15am on Thursday, 7/25/19. If you get here earlier, please get some coffee or tea at Starbucks downstairs, and then come up at 9:15am.

 

When you enter the building, check in with building security and tell them that you are here to see Academia. They will tell you which elevator to use. When you enter the Academia space, you will see an iPad that says "Academia" on it. Please sign in and select, "Engineering Interview". This will alert our engineering team and one of our engineering managers will come out to greet you.

 

 

 What to Expect

 For the day, you'll be given a coding challenge to design from scratch. You will be able to use the language of your choice, but we highly recommend that you use Python, Ruby, or JavaScript (Node.js). Use whichever of those you feel most comfortable with, and brush up on the basic syntax for defining classes, methods, and flow control. If you donâ€™t think you would feel comfortable in any of those languages, please let us know as soon as you get this email and which language you would prefer. You will be programming on a machine that we will provide. As you move forward, we urge you to ask questions and feel comfortable to back out of a direction if you want to try another method.

 
You'll also be served a catered lunch along with the team. If you like, you'll be invited to play foosball with the group during lunch as well. Members of the team will take you to dinner too  (this is optional). These are more informal opportunities for you to meet/interact with the team.
